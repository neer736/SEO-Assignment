    <h1>FAVICON</h1>
    <p>
        A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, often square image or icon associated with a website or webpage. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, bookmarks, tabs, and sometimes in search results when users visit a website. Favicons are used to provide a visual representation of a website or webpage, making it easier for users to identify and distinguish it from other open tabs or bookmarks in their browser.
        Usually, a favicon is 16 x 16 pixels in size and stored in the GIF, PNG, or ICO file format.
        hey are used to improve user experience and enforce brand consistency. When a familiar icon is seen in the browser's address bar, for example, it helps users know they are in the right place. <br> <br>
        Example: we can see google,twiter,facebook,amazon and many other companies use their first letter of company name as "favicon".
